I put posts up on Facebook and Instagram, seeing if anyone would take her off my hands. No one I know could take in the kitten.

So I started feeding her and giving her attention and keeping her warm. She‚Äôs a good little cat! I gotta keep her outside, but I‚Äôm doing everything I can for her. I never thought I‚Äôd get attached to a cat, lol

240 volts in all 120v outlets after hurricane Milton in Florida,"Came home from Miami, back to st Pete as my neighbor said my power was on, and my fridge was working. I got to my house and flipped a switch for the light to come on, immediately breaker flipped. 
I thought it was weird, but went to open my fridge only to smell a burnt electronic smell. The inside threshold for the fridge door was super hot, almost enough to burn my hand. 
At this point I knew something was not right. I got out my multi-meter only to read 240 volts on every single outlet in my home. I switched off the breaker and called the electric company, but it‚Äôs likely I‚Äôll be out of power for a while as so many people have downed lines here. 
My question is, how could this have happened  the day after the hurricane, and what does this mean for anything I had plugged in? 
Several appliances were still working, but I can‚Äôt imagine with the smell and non functioning of some things that it bodes well. I‚Äôm fairly certain the company also didn‚Äôt come out after the storm, because very few of my neighbors have power currently. ",2024-10-11 14:24:19,670,3565,https://i.redd.it/ykqi5iok66ud1.jpeg

It was supposed to be hurricane proof from what I‚Äôve heard in the construction, but this is clearly not the case. 

The entire island the hotel is on was essentially underwater as well as the first floor of the hotel. Mud is everywhere.

Our Administration will be here for as long as it takes to recover and rebuild. We encourage survivors to apply for FEMA assistance, which can be done by:

WIBTA for abandoning my family during hurricane milton?,"i (21F) reside in a mandatory evacuation zone for hurricane milton and my parents (53F 52M) are absolutely refusing to evacuate our house. my boyfriend who lives in orlando traveled over an hour to see me this morning to try and offer my parents a place to stay with him, to convince them to leave since nothing i‚Äôve said has had any effect, bring us sandbags and help us board up our windows in last minute preparations (since my parents didn‚Äôt even want to do that much.) i‚Äôm extremely stressed out and worried for the safety of my family which includes my teenage brother and our two cats, because if we are to be hit as hard as the news predicts it‚Äôs unfair of us as their owners who are responsible for their wellbeing to make them suffer unnecessarily. i even asked my boyfriend if he would be willing to take my cats back to orlando with him and have them stay at his parents place for a little until the storm passes, to which he of course agreed, but my mother doubled down and insisted that things will be fine and she can handle taking care of the cats. the entire situation is surreal to me. i can‚Äôt understand the root of my parents stubbornness, maybe it‚Äôs material attachment, but to willingly put me, my brother, and my cats‚Äô wellbeings at risk is unfathomable to me. i feel like they‚Äôre not taking it seriously because we‚Äôve never been seriously impacted by a hurricane before, and they‚Äôre under the assumption they‚Äôll be able to just ride it out like any other storm, but this isn‚Äôt any other storm. when my bf and i pressed the issue before he left back home my father snapped at me and told me if i want to go, then to just go and that they‚Äôll be fine here at home. my bf tells me that my brother and i shouldn‚Äôt have to pay the cost of their decision or be obligated to stay just because they choose to. i want to prioritize my own and my cats wellbeing but at the same time the thought of leaving my parents behind obviously breaks my heart, what could i possibly do? WIBTA if i were to leave?

EDIT: i already posted a separate update post but i figured since this is still gaining steady traction i would update here too. our plan changed last minute (again) but me, my parents, my brother and our cats, ended up staying with a group of relatives 30mi further inland. unfortunately not orlando like the original plan as my father deemed it would have been too dangerous to drive that far on the roads this morning when we woke up at 7 but i am genuinely very happy to have my entire family with me and had we gone to orlando to stay with my boyfriend like intended my mother would most likely have stayed behind in a local emergency shelter as she didn‚Äôt want to travel that far. we left at 9am, arrived maybe around 10am and it is currently 10pm, experiencing fluctuating rain and wind strength but so far we still have power/water/etc. my cats are probably a little stressed, but otherwise safe and healthy and thankfully did very well on the car ride over here. i‚Äôve been on the phone with my boyfriend and us and our families are all still doing well. thank you so much for everyone who is invested in our wellbeing, will update again after the hurricane passes. <3

FINAL UPDATE: we got home earlier this morning and thankfully aside from some flooded roads, lots of debris and a loss of power, our house/neighborhood is all good. so now i guess my parents can say i told you so lol :) but i‚Äôm very relieved and very fortunate to be able to say that and i‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not the alternative. my relatives whose house we were staying in also experienced no flooding or major damage, and the drive home wasn‚Äôt bad either. the cats are also okay! the only injuries we sustained overall are some scratches from trying to give one of them a bath (because he shit himself in the carrier on the way home.) other than that though everyone is safe and well and i cannot thank everyone enough for your concern and support. thank you to everyone who reached out to share their stories and experiences and i hope you all remain safe, prepared and precautious for any storms ahead.

Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration‚Äôs Response to Hurricane Milton.,"President Biden has directed his Administration to do everything possible to prepare for Hurricane Milton:

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can‚Äôt evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 ‚Äì October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development‚Äôs mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it‚Äôs often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads ‚Äì as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 ‚Äì October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power ‚Äì because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 12:10:30,301,4067,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1fzv4nw/quick_update_on_the_bidenharris_administrations/

"Signs of Collapse, summary of 2018","Hi /r/collapse!

LPT Be extra cautious buying a used car in the months after a hurricane or major flooding event,"Many cars damaged by rising waters are written off by insurers as a total loss, and their titles are marked as such. They will be sold as salvage and not intended to be driven again. But it's very common for people to buy the salvage vehicles at auction and instead of stripping them for usable parts or recyclable metal as is intended, they are cheaply repaired and resold, sometimes many states or provinces away so just because you're nowhere near the hurricane doesn't mean you won't still get one of these water damaged vehicles. Not only are they a huge risk for mold nd rust, but they can have massive electrical and engine problems in the future that can be hidden for a short time.

Inspect the title very carefully, and demand a carfax or other vin history to see where it was previously registered and any prior insurance claims if possible to make sure you're not just buying future headaches.",2024-09-27 09:21:02,171,9194,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1fqnkmw/lpt_be_extra_cautious_buying_a_used_car_in_the/

My parents evacuated from the hurricane...only to turn back and just go back home,"Yep. Title says it all. My brown boomer parents live in Pinellas Park, which is still pretty much in the direct path of the hurricane. I had cried and begged them on the phone yesterday that they needed to evacuate, and they should come with me and my signifcant other down to West Palm to join up with his mom. We would have left earlier if my graduate school announced they were going to close sooner...oh well.

Anyhow, it took five plus calls and numerous text messages and the 'Guess I'm going to be an ophan' card to get them to drive over to Riverview. To make things ‚ú®Ô∏è even better ‚ú®Ô∏è my dad's car is having issues with the hybrid battery and he's relying on his so called 'backup' battery. His car can literally die at any time. It's been like that since hurricane Helene and GreenBean Battery has not had the chance to have one of their contractors come and help.

Dad somehow made it here to Riverview miraculously with mom, and all was going well. I made them dinner and we watched TV and it was like a sleepover. I kept warning them that Riverview might become unsafe too and we would all have to move. The plan was to use my s/o's car to boot all of us including the two furry tuxedo cats. Because MY car wasn't in a condition to go long distances either because the strut, boot and a whole bunch of other stuff broke down (great timing right?) And needs to be replaced.

Come this morning the projected path is now RIVERVIEW, and I woke up and told them we all gotta go further south. All they heard was 'Ah St Pete and Pinellas are safe now'. I explained to them that, that was not the case at all, they would still have storm surges, their fruit trees will fall, etc etc.

As they grabbed all their stuff and moved the fastest I have seen these two old folk move, I was befuddled. I looked at them and said 'Do you guys just want to pass away in your own home? Is that what's going on?'

My parents laughed, gave us hugs, and drove off.

By any chance, if anyone here recognizes who I am, my s/o and I am safe, and we have a plan. I just wanted to share how absolutely ridiculously stupid my parents are.

By the way, are there discounts on double caskets?

EDIT ONE: Safely situated in West Palm with other side of family. My s/o's niece straight up said ""If your parents pass away, you can have my room and I will make you a Hello Kitty necklace."" I will gladly take her up on that offer,  lol. Also thank you all for the support and I hope you guys are safe, both from the physical harms of the hurricane, and the emotional turmoil your parents are giving you, too. Love you all.

EDIT TWO: Everyone I know and love including my 0 IQ boomer parents are alive and well. Just deeply saddened downtown St Pete has suffered. Stay strong.",2024-10-08 12:53:38,332,2948,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1fz4lnf/my_parents_evacuated_from_the_hurricaneonly_to/

Why do people not evacuate during a major weather event like Hurricane Helene?,"At least twenty people have died during Hurricane Helene so far, and more than a few of them were people who didn't evacuate when told to. As someone who lives in the upper Midwest of the USA, this behavior is utterly baffling to me. If I lived in the path of a storm like this, I'd bug out of there ASAP.

I'm noticing a huge uptick in misinformation and a lack of basic hurricane education leading up to Milton. ,"I'm not sure if it's the transplants or if this has always been the case and I just haven't noticed, but I'm seeing more people than usual are failing to comprehend hurricane basics this time around and are going into pure panic mode.

Lots of people not understanding storm surge vs inland flooding.

Lots of people evacuating their brand new construction homes 30+ miles inland where they are completely safe.

Hell - I'm seeing numerous comments from people claiming it will be over Wesley Chapel & New Tampa as a sustained Cat 4 when it will certainly deteriorate prior to and during landfall.

Just a reminder, when you hear a meteorologist say that 90% of hurricane deaths are from storm surge and flooding - and that you are safe inland if you're not a mobile home or in a flood zone. That's real advice from experts you can trust. They're trying to save lives in coastal communities and flood zones. I don't understand how people hear that and think that their cement block house 40 miles inland is going to be torn from its foundation.

If you're in a safe structure inland like I've described around Wesley Chapel, you need to worry about the roads in your neighborhood being flooded and having no power for a few days. That's the preparation you need to be focused on.

A lot of commenters also recommended a meteorologist on YouTube I've also watched for quite a bit, [Ryan Hall](https://www.youtube.com/@RyanHallYall). He will be streaming throughout landfall and is usually a great source for live info.

Wanted to also point out there are a ton of reasons you might want to evacuate even if you live inland. If you are not in a safe structure, have special needs, tons of tall heavy trees nearby or can't handle going without power for a few days, definitely consider it.

The primary goal of this post was to point out the overwhelming advice is to shelter in place if you have a safe new construction home far away from the storm surge. Take the hurricane seriously. I sandbagged my sliding glass door and stocked up for the expected loss of power. If you still want to evacuate that's perfectly fine but know you do have options. 

The only comment that is really getting to me is comparing us to Asheville. If you are comparing flat suburban Florida flooding to Mountainous flash floods from runoff I promise there is more critical thought to be had.
